# In-Depth Usage
This page will detail the specifics of the `curses` port of the program, and how to use it effectively.

## Commands
You can send commands to the program through the `:` key. This will open a command prompt at the bottom of the screen. You can then type in a command, and press `Enter` to execute it. Pressing `Esc` will close the command prompt without executing the command.
