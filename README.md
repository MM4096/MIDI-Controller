# MIDI-CONTROLLER
## Overview
This is a project I started due to a lack of proper resources for creating patch lists for my Korg Kross 2 on Ubuntu.

This program is a command-line interface (CLI) program, built with Python, using the `mido` library for midi control, and the `curses` library for terminal styling.

***This program has undergone a major overhaul, and documentation may be missing.
Hopefully all the important stuff is here, but you can refer back to the [previous documentation](documentation/old_instructions.md) if you find something missing.***
